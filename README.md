# Proxmox-VM-Template


<p>This repo contains the files that I use to deploy a VM template onto Proxmox VE 7.2</p>

<p>Clone this repo into a directory directly into the Promox node that you are going to work with. Modify the build-vars file to match your environment. You can either chmod the script to execute with sh build-image.sh</p>
